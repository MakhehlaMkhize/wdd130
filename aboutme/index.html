    <h3>Mkhize (Pronounced: Mmm-Key-Ze)</h3>
    <p>I am currently working towards a bachelors degree in Applied Technology. The degree choice is motivated by the work space I
        am currently in which is so primitive when it comes to documentation. The knowledge I will gain as I work
        towards my degree will be of great benefit to my workspace.
    </p>
    <p>I enjoy watching movies and spending time with my wife. I have been married for five years and I have been
        blessed
        with two boys who were choice spirits, thus were not permited to be tainted by the woes of this world.

        A great part of my life had been dedicated to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I have been a member of the organisation for eleven years.
        A motivating quote that I love from the scriptures is a quote found in The Book of Mormon in Mosiah 2:17 "And behold, I tell you these things that ye may 
        learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God."
        I feel this is what Jesus Christ meant when He taught about the two greatest commandments.
